## Features

- **Foundation-Free**: Lightweight and portable, with no dependencies on Foundation.
- **High-Level Data Extraction**: Easily extract all URLs from a document or selection with `doc.urls(from:)`.
- **Powerful Queries**: Use convenient CSS selectors or the full power of XPath on both HTML and XML.
- **Experimental Stream Parsing**: Process very large documents (e.g., XML data feeds) with a low memory footprint.
- **Simple API**: Get started in seconds with `parseHTML(string:)` and `parseXML(string:)`.
- **Experimental Concurrency Support**: Includes a `ParsingService` actor for uncommon scenarios requiring thread-safe parsing.

## Build Requirements

- Swift 6.1+
- `libxml2`. This library is a wrapper around the C library `libxml2`.
  - On Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS), this is provided by the system and no action is needed.
  - On Ubuntu, you must install the development package: `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev`. Other distributions may require a similar package (e.g., `libxml2-devel` on Fedora).

## Supported Platforms

- Darwin (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS)
- Linux (Ubuntu). Other distributions like Amazon Linux 2 and Fedora are not officially tested but may work.

## Installation

Add ya-swift-html-xml-parser as a dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/your-username/ya-swift-html-xml-parser.git", from: "0.0.1")
]
```

## Usage

### HTML Parsing

Use `parseHTML(string:)` to work with HTML documents. This function is lenient by default, handling malformed or incomplete HTML just like a web browser.

#### Example: Scraping Media URLs

A common task in web scraping is to find all URLs for media, links, or embedded content. The `urls(from:)` method simplifies this. It accepts an `OptionSet` called `URLTagOptions` that lets you specify exactly which tags to extract URLs from.

This is especially useful for building scrapers for media sites (e.g., finding movie trailers or image galleries).

```swift
import ya_swift_xml

let mediaHTML = """
<article>
  <h1>My Movie Review</h1>
  <a href="/reviews/home">Home</a>
  <img src="/poster.jpg" alt="Movie Poster">
  <video poster="/video-poster.png">
    <source src="/movie-trailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <iframe src="https://player.example.com/movie/123"></iframe>
</article>
"""

do {
    let mediaDoc = try parseHTML(string: mediaHTML)

    // Example 1: Find only video sources and embedded players.
    let videoURLs = mediaDoc.urls(from: [.source, .iframe])
    print("Video Content URLs: \(videoURLs)")
    // Prints: Video Content URLs: ["/movie-trailer.mp4", "https://player.example.com/movie/123"]

    // Example 2: Get every supported URL from the document using .all.
    let allContentURLs = mediaDoc.urls(from: .all)
    print("All URLs: \(allContentURLs)")
    // Prints: All URLs: ["/reviews/home", "/poster.jpg", "/video-poster.png", "/movie-trailer.mp4", "https://player.example.com/movie/123"]
} catch {
     print("HTML parsing failed: \(error)")
}
```

#### Example: Basic Queries and Text Access

You can also perform basic queries and access element attributes and text content directly.

```swift
import ya_swift_xml

let html = """
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="main" class="content">
        <p>Here is a link: <a href="/page1">Page 1</a></p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
"""

do {
    // Parse the HTML string.
    let doc = try parseHTML(string: html)

    // Use CSS selectors to find an element.
    if let link = try doc.select("#main a").first {
        // The .text property recursively gets all text content from a node.
        print("Link text: \(link.text)") // Prints: Link text: Page 1

        // Access attributes using subscripting.
        if let href = link.attributes["href"] {
            print("Link URL: \(href)") // Prints: Link URL: /page1
        }
    }
} catch {
    print("HTML parsing failed: \(error)")
}
```

### XML Parsing

Use `parseXML(string:)` for well-formed XML documents. By default, this function is **strict** and will throw an error if the XML is not perfectly well-formed. This is ideal for validation and ensuring data integrity. For more advanced control, see the "Parsing Strategies" section below.

```swift
import ya_swift_xml

let xml = """
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>My Blog</title>
    <item>
      <title>Hello World</title>
      <description>My first post!</description>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Second Post</title>
      <description>Another exciting update.</description>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
"""

do {
    // 1. Parse the XML string using the default strict parser.
    let doc = try parseXML(string: xml)

    // 2. You can use CSS selectors on XML too.
    if let channelTitle = try doc.select("channel > title").first {
        print("Channel Title: \(channelTitle.text)") // Prints: "Channel Title: My Blog"
    }

    // 3. Iterate through all items and print their titles.
    print("\nBlog Posts:")
    let items = try doc.select("item")
    for item in items {
        if let itemTitle = item.select("title").first {
            print("- \(itemTitle.text)")
        }
    }
    // Prints:
    // Blog Posts:
    // - Hello World
    // - Second Post

} catch {
    print("XML parsing failed: \(error)")
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### Parsing Strategies (Strict vs. Lenient)

While the `parseXML` function is strict by default, you can easily switch to a lenient, error-recovering strategy by providing different `MemoryParserOptions`.

```swift
// This XML has a mismatched closing tag.
let recoverableXML = "<feed><title>Title</wrong_tag></feed>"

// Using the default strict parser would throw an error.
// _ = try parseXML(string: recoverableXML) // Throws XMLError

// By passing different options, you can enable lenient parsing.
do {
    let doc = try parseXML(string: recoverableXML, options: .lenientXML)
    // The parser recovers, and you can now work with the document.
    let title = try doc.select("title").first?.text
    print(title ?? "No title found") // Prints: "Title"
} catch {
    // This block will not be reached.
}
```

### Performance Considerations

For parsing a large number of documents, it is more efficient to create and reuse a single `MemoryParser` instance.

```swift
let parser = MemoryParser()
for xmlString in lotsOfXMLStrings {
    let doc = try parser.parse(string: xmlString)
    // ... process doc
}
```

### Concurrency

The `ParsingService` actor provides a safe way to perform parsing operations from multiple concurrent tasks. Because the underlying C library (`libxml2`) is not thread-safe, the actor serializes all parsing calls to prevent race conditions and crashes.

A common use case is to offload parsing work from the main thread in a UI application to keep it responsive. The example below shows how to parse a batch of documents concurrently in a background task.

```swift
import ya_swift_xml

let service = ParsingService()
let docsToParse = [
    "<doc><title>Doc 1</title></doc>",
    "<doc><title>Doc 2</title></doc>",
    "<bad-doc" // This one will fail
]

do {
    let titles = try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: String.self, returning: [String].self) { group in
        for xml in docsToParse {
            group.addTask {
                return try await service.parseXMLAndExtract(string: xml) { doc in
                    try doc.select("title").first?.text ?? "Untitled"
                }
            }
        }

        var collected = [String]()
        for try await title in group {
            collected.append(title)
        }
        return collected
    }
    print("Successfully parsed titles: \(titles)")
} catch {
    print("A parsing task failed: \(error)")
}
// Prints: A parsing task failed: parsingError(message: "Premature end of data in tag bad-doc line 1")
```

#### Important Considerations

When using the `ParsingService`, keep the following in mind:

- **Error Handling**: Since any parsing task can fail, always use a `withThrowingTaskGroup` and be prepared to handle errors.
- **Result Order**: The order of results collected from a `TaskGroup` is not guaranteed and may differ from the order in which the tasks were added.
- **`XMLDocument` is Not `Sendable`**: The `XMLDocument` object itself is not thread-safe and must not be passed out of the actor. The `parse...AndExtract` methods are designed to handle this safely by letting you work on the document inside a closure and only returning a `Sendable` result.

### Stream Parsing (for Large Files)

`StreamParser` processes large documents piece-by-piece to minimize memory usage. You provide a custom handler to react to parsing events as they occur.

```swift
import ya_swift_xml

class MyEventHandler: StreamEventHandler {
    var elementCount = 0
    func handleEvent(_ event: StreamEvent) {
        if case .startElement = event {
            elementCount += 1
        }
    }
}

let handler = MyEventHandler()
let parser = try StreamParser(handler: handler)

do {
    try parser.parseFile(at: "/path/to/large.xml")
    print("Parsed \(handler.elementCount) elements from the stream.")
} catch {
    print("Stream parsing failed: \(error)")
}
```

## Comparison to SwiftSoup

**SwiftSoup** is a popular, pure-Swift HTML parser. `ya-swift-html-xml-parser` has a different design philosophy and may be suitable for different tasks.

| Feature               | ya-swift-html-xml-parser                                         | SwiftSoup                                             |

| **Dependencies**      | None (Foundation-free).                              | None (Pure Swift).                                    |
| **API Philosophy**    | Minimalist, focusing on querying and data extraction. | Comprehensive, supporting complex DOM manipulation.   |
| **Memory Strategy**   | Offers both in-memory and a `StreamParser` for large files. | Primarily in-memory.                                  |
| **Concurrency**       | Provides an actor for uncommon thread-safe parsing needs. | Thread-safety is managed by the user.                 |
| **Ideal Use Case**    | Fast data extraction and scraping where a minimal API is sufficient. | Projects that need to modify the DOM, or where a pure-Swift dependency is required. |

In short, choose **ya-swift-html-xml-parser** for a lightweight tool focused on fast data extraction. Choose **SwiftSoup** when you need a comprehensive, pure-Swift toolkit for more complex DOM manipulation.
